# API: 3D Buildings in Cologne (LoD2)

https://demo.ldproxy.net/cologne_lod2

## Scope

Together with a digital terrain model, 3D building models describe the natural terrain shape of the earth's surface, including all buildings and structures, in digital form and enable the representation of cities and towns in virtual worlds. Buildings can be modeled in different levels of detail (Level of Detail, LoD). In the 3D building model LoD2, the modeling of the buildings is done with standardized roof shapes such as a gable or hip roof.

Resource types: Features, 3D Tiles, Styles

## Notes

The data in this API is an extract from the statewide data (rectangle in the city of Cologne with 2 km x 3 km edge length, 10500 buildings).

The building properties and their values are in German.

This API is disabled by default, because of the need to first start a PosqlgrSQL database and load the data. See below.

## Data source

License: [Datenlizenz Deutschland - Zero â€“ Version 2.0](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/zero-2-0)

This data source requires two docker containers. In addition to ldproxy, we also need a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. This complicates the setup and this data source has therefore been disabled by default. To include this data source, execute the following steps:

* Move `cologne_lod2/provider/cologne_lod2.yml` to `store/entities/features/withTiles/providers/cologne_lod2.yml`.
* Move `cologne_lod2/service/cologne_lod2.yml` to `store/entities/features/withTiles/services/cologne_lod2.yml`.
* Set `ENABLE_ZOOMSTACK` in `docker-compose.yml` to `true`.

To start ldproxy:

* First start the database using `docker compose up db -d`.
* Monitor the progress with `docker logs -f db_demo`. 
* When the "database system is ready to accept connections", start ldproxy using `docker compose up ldproxy -d`. The list of APIs should now include "3D Buildings in Cologne (LoD2)".

To generate the PostgreSQL database dump with the 3D building data yourself, follow these steps:
